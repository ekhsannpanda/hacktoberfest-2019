My name is YH! I don't actually know what I'm doing.

I know I can use an assortment of formatting, but I just like to keep it plain and simple. ;)

Random fact no.1: I don't like hotdogs. Been eating them for 6 years straight every evening during my childhood. Never again.

Finally, here's an image of me! I look just like Bob.
