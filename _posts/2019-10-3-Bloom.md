My name is Bloom! I am a student with a little bit of C++ wizardry.

I like programming because programming stimulates my brain.

> Yeah sex is nice, but have you tried writing code perfectly without bugs?

Unfortunately, I play too many games in my free time instead of actually writing code. For those who want to walk down the path of darkness with me, I play `osu!` and other games under the alias **Bloom** or **LumpBloom7**.

For those who want to go the path of light with me, my github profile is [LumpBloom7](https://github.com/LumpBloom7).

Now that I have introduced myself, let me introduce you to my waifu.
Her name is Marisa Kirisame, and she's a magician from Gensokyo.
She keeps me happy because she is so kawaii.
